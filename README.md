“Explore Our Lands of History”

  There are still many local tourists who are less interested in visiting historical sites in Indonesia. How to build an application that can increase the interest of local tourists to visit historical sites? How to help local tourists to recognize historical sites in Indonesia? We want to build an application that provides interesting articles about historical sites in Indonesia and helps local tourists to be able to recognize a historical site in Indonesia through a smartphone camera. With that, the interest of local tourists to visit historical sites is increasing and local tourists can find out the names, addresses, and history of historical sites in Indonesia. We want all Indonesian people to be able to preserve the historical sites in this country and not let these places be buried by time.
   So we make an application called gasturah, an application that will provide information about historical sites in Indonesia and can identify historical sites in Indonesia through the image recognition feature. So that users can recognize and study historical sites that are around them and preserve them so that they are not buried by the times. Besides, this application also informs the nearest historical sites from the user's location. Users can also share their experiences on historical sites that they have visited.
